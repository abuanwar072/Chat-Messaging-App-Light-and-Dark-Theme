Today we are going to build a messing/chat app #ui using #flutter that runs on both Android and iOS devices, it also has a dark and light theme. We will create a total of 4 screens that all support both Dark Theme and Light Theme. First we will design a welcome screen that contains an image with a tag line also that has a skip button. Once the user presses it, it will transfer them to the Sign-in or Sign-up screen. The other screens are the main screen and Chats screen, it shows the list of people you have chatted with and the message screen which supports text message, audio message, and video messages.
